Sarcasm detection is a complex task within natural language processing due to the challenge of identifying
instances where the intended meaning contrasts with the literal meaning. This paper addresses this
challenge by examining sarcasm in tweets, which is particularly interesting due to informal language,
emojis, abbreviations, and ambiguous text.

Therefore, this project aims to answer the question: How do different machine learning models, from
simpler algorithms to complex transformer-based models, perform in detecting sarcasm in English
tweets?

The primary objective of this project is to explore and compare four different machine-learning models
with increasing levels of complexity, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI).
Furthermore, this project mainly focuses on a designated dataset of tweets, aiming to advance research in
sarcasm detection by providing practical ML insights for researchers working on social media data.
Expected outcomes include identifying the most effective ML model for sarcasm detection in tweets and
highlighting the challenges this brings, including the importance of context and non-standard textual
elements, such as emojis
